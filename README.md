# git-hop

hop between branches which are pointing to the HEAD commit

originally created for [git-stacked-rebase](https://github.com/kiprasmel/git-stacked-rebase) - at the time we were automatically updating the `nightly` branch to point to the latest commit, and checking out the nightly branch was the easiest way to find which branch was the latest in the stack. now, the only thing missing was a quick way to jump to the actual intended branch - here git-hop helps.
